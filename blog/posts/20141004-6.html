With such a large group, many BME students feel that it is&nbsp;often&nbsp;difficult to interact with and form strong relationships with&nbsp;their peers, upperclassmen,&nbsp;and alumni. To&nbsp;address&nbsp;this issue, a small group of students and faculty gathered last&nbsp;November&nbsp;to brainstorm&nbsp;ways to bring&nbsp;BME students&nbsp;at Georgia Tech&nbsp;together and create a more close-knit community&nbsp;within&nbsp;the&nbsp;Walter H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering at Georgia Tech and Emory.&nbsp;One of the&nbsp;many ideas that emerged was&nbsp;the BME Mentorship Program, which&nbsp;came to life with the help of dedicated student leaders.
<br>
<br>
The Mentorship Program is&nbsp;the&nbsp;first major project launched under&nbsp;the BME Learning Commons, which was created with four major points of focus:&nbsp; curriculum, careers, connections, and creativity. The program has&nbsp;two tiers; one of which&nbsp;focuses on relationships&nbsp;between&nbsp;the upperclassmen mentors and BME alumni&nbsp;while&nbsp;the&nbsp;other&nbsp;fosters similar connections between the same student mentors and&nbsp;the&nbsp;BME freshmen. From the alumni, older students receive valuable career information,&nbsp;job opportunities, and&nbsp;access to networking opportunities in the biomedical engineering field. At the same time, they are able to assist the freshmen&nbsp;with learning and networking within the&nbsp;Coulter&nbsp;Department at Georgia Tech.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br>
As&nbsp;founder and sponsor of the BME Mentorship Program,&nbsp;Associate Professor Joe Le&nbsp;Doux&nbsp;describes the program&nbsp;as a way to “foster student belonging and engagement” by&nbsp;concentrating&nbsp;on arguably the most vulnerable sub-set of BME students:&nbsp;freshmen. For first-year BME&nbsp;students at Georgia Tech,&nbsp;coursework, talking to professors&nbsp;and&nbsp;upper-classmen, and balancing academics&nbsp;with college life&nbsp;are all&nbsp;stressful and&nbsp;often&nbsp;overwhelming.&nbsp;This new program&nbsp;attempts&nbsp;to fix these issues by pairing each BME freshman with an older student mentor who can give&nbsp;freshmen&nbsp;access to helpful tips on transition&nbsp;to college life, time management, and advice on how to study for different classes.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<br>
In order to maximize the helpfulness of the mentor-mentee relationship, a detailed matching process&nbsp;began&nbsp;prior to the start of the fall semester. Over the summer, older BME students applied for mentorship positions&nbsp;through an online application. These applications were then compiled into a database&nbsp;where freshmen could narrow their search parameters to find mentors with similar interests&nbsp;and long-term goals. A week before the first day&nbsp;of class,&nbsp;each mentor&nbsp;was&nbsp;paired with three or four freshmen students. A similar matching process,&nbsp;conducted through Mentor Jackets,&nbsp;serves to match the student mentors and the alumni&nbsp;involved in the BME Mentorship Program.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>
The&nbsp;first annual&nbsp;“Welcome to BME&nbsp;Day”&nbsp;was&nbsp;held&nbsp;on&nbsp;Saturday after the&nbsp;first week of school. Student&nbsp;mentors and mentees were able to meet each other,&nbsp;and freshmen were able to sign up for various BME-related student groups on campus.&nbsp;Ideally, mentoring families&nbsp;meet for&nbsp;roughly an hour each week&nbsp;to&nbsp;give the mentees a chance to share how things are going,&nbsp;ask their mentor questions,&nbsp;or just have fun. In addition, the Mentoring program Student Leadership team, led by&nbsp;Dhara&nbsp;Patel and&nbsp;Veena&nbsp;Ganapathy, hope&nbsp;to create one or two events each semester&nbsp;similar to the&nbsp;“Welcome to BME Day”&nbsp;that will serve to bring all of&nbsp;the&nbsp;program’s participants together.&nbsp;Third-year BME student Meaghan&nbsp;Desilets, a student mentor in this new program,&nbsp;thinks that a mentor would have been very beneficial during her first&nbsp;year at Georgia Tech. She also thinks that&nbsp;the&nbsp;matching system works very well because&nbsp;she and&nbsp;her&nbsp;freshmen mentees&nbsp;have “similar mindsets and goals,&nbsp;so I can give them&nbsp;pretty&nbsp;relevant advice.”&nbsp;

The BME Mentorship Program is&nbsp;the first of several programs under the effort of the BME&nbsp;Learning Commons. Le&nbsp;Doux&nbsp;offers assurances that there are “plenty of other programs in the works”&nbsp;in addition to the BME Mentorship Program,&nbsp;such as&nbsp;the&nbsp;BME Dinner Jackets&nbsp;program, the Podcast Studio, and the Career Pathways project.&nbsp;As a&nbsp;primarily&nbsp;student-driven, student-led program, BME Mentorship Program will hopefully create&nbsp;a better sense of belonging for&nbsp;students and pave a path for more opportunities to come.<!-- /content -->
