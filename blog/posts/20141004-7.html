At Georgia Tech, it is always apparent when a career fair is happening. Streams of students swap their flip-flops, t-shirts, and backpacks to parade across campus in leather shoes and black suits, clutching padfolios overflowing with carefully reviewed resumes.
<br>
<br>
Whether you are in search of information, a job, or simply practice for talking to recruiters, the Biotechnology Career Fair is a professionally productive opportunity. It is a chance to interact with some of the biggest names in our industry, from St. Jude Medical to Proctor &amp; Gamble. Upon registration, you receive a nametag and a list containing all the companies in attendance and the positions they are hiring for. Once in, your work is cut out for you. Pick a line for a company that fits your needs, wait your turn, and get ready to impress the recruiter.
<br>
<br>
Some of the basics:
<ul>
<li>Make sure you dress appropriately (business casual) because first impressions are important in brief interactions.</li>
<li>Allocate enough time in your schedule for the fair.</li>
<li>Research the companies attending the fairs and prioritize the employers you are most interested in.</li>
<li>Introduce yourself, welcome the recruiter to Georgia Tech, and be prepared to give your "career pitch." A career pitch involves expressing your interest in the company and emphasizing your strengths in less than sixty seconds.</li>
<li>Take notes and ask the recruiter for his or her business card.</li>
<li>Be sure to follow up with the recruiter after the career fair with an email or personalized card, thanking them for their time.</li>
</ul>
What do companies look for?
<br>
<br>
At this past career fair, representatives from several companies were asked for advice on how to approach recruiters at fairs and what qualities to focus on:
<br>
<br>
“We look for people who are positive, work well with a team, and display qualities of leadership. Our work environment is very positive and productive, something we take pride in, and we want to keep it that way at all levels, especially with our interns and co-ops” - Recruiter with St. Jude Medical
<br>
<br>
“I think that it is important to do your background research on a company. You can figure out what you really want. Do this before the fair if you are looking for a job; do it at the fair if you’re young and just want to get a feel for the company.” - Recruiter with Huron Consulting Group
<br>
<br>
“The important thing that you can capitalize on at a career fair versus just applying online is who you know. For example, feel free to use my name. I am senior manager with Biosense Webster and when you apply for a job with us, that carries weight. It’s good to get recruiters familiarized with your name as well as to use their names in your applications.” - Recruiter with Johnson &amp; Johnson
<br>
<br>
Regardless of whether or not you leave a career fair with an interview, you come out of it with a better knowledge of how to approach recruiters. You also gain the ability to gauge a company and what you want from it. It is good practice, if anything – a stepping-stone towards a job or internship. So look up career tips, get dressed up, head out, and hit up the next career fair on campus!<!-- /content -->
