I am referring to that palm-sized brick of plastic and metal in your pocket that not only links you to a sprawling, content-rich network of people and information but could also, in the not so distant future, be your very next doctor.

Granted, the notion of a single gadget being able to replace or even outdo a physician is far from our current reality, but the urge to innovate and adapt “smart” technologies (namely, smart devices) for healthcare purposes is rapidly growing. With the advent of this technology, there now exists an expectation to be able to mobilize and simplify the tools with which healthcare personnel collect information for diagnosis. For instance, a pair of doctors at Stanford has developed adapters that, when attached to a smartphone camera, enable the user to capture images of both the front surface of the eye and the retina on the back surface. Considering the bulk of most ophthalmology instruments, these adapters (called EyeGo) provide a major boon for mobile diagnostics; the “smart” benefit manifests itself in being able to triage in emergency situations or in locations without the larger instruments.

In a growing number of smart applications, however, this benefit has begun to expand past compaction and into interpretation of collected data. Currently in development, an app by the name of BiliCam has shown promising results in the detection of infant jaundice, a disease in which the baby’s liver is not yet mature enough to process bilirubin; in turn, excess bilirubin in the bloodstream creates a characteristic yellow discoloration. The application is designed to take advantage of a smartphone camera for assessment of bilirubin levels by using it to capture the color of the infant’s skin. The app then analyzes collected data using cloud-based machine-learning algorithms, given parameters such as the baby’s skin tone and lighting conditions. In the same vein as BiliCam is AF Detect, another application that traces very minute changes in color on the skin of a person’s face to detect distinct changes of blood flow that are characteristic of atrial fibrillation. Beyond these two, there are still many other applications in development that make the most of the interpretive capabilities that the mobile “smart” platform provides.

So, will the next doctor you visit be sitting in your pocket? Probably not any time soon, but the future of smart devices in the healthcare holds plenty of promise. Recognizing an illness is a great tool to have on a smartphone, but let us hope that when that vision finally does become reality, the next notification coming from your phone after having taken your latest selfie is not an urgent recommendation for you to visit your nearest emergency room!<!-- /content -->
