Saturday, August 23rd marked the takeoff of the first BME Mentorship Program here at Georgia Tech. Created to help accommodate new freshmen students to the major and of all its opportunities, the Mentorship Program is comprised of nearly 160 students who have volunteered to serve as mentors. All the mentees and mentors were paired up before Georgia Tech's fall semester began according to their interest of study in BME. For instance, a pre-health student interested in pursuing research would have been assigned pre-health mentor who has research experience.

To start off the semester, the BME Mentoring Program Leadership Team organized an orientation event, “Welcome to BME Day”, to help facilitate introductory interactions between mentors and mentees as well as provide mentees a way to learn more about BME opportunities. Held in the Student Center Ballroom, it was an “open-house” event where organizations and other exhibits hosted tables that mentors and mentees could visit to learn more about their organizations; organizations from GT Neuro to Minority Association of Pre-Medical Students talked to the freshmen about their focus and upcoming events. Some mentor-mentee pairs even had the opportunity to participate in MOVE’s “Into the Streets” community service projects, which were happening before the BME Day event, or receive free passes to the HealthCare Hackathon!

Not only did students get the opportunity to participate in community service, attend the hackathon, and register for organizations that interested them, they also got to meet some of the Biomedical Engineering faculty and get their insight on the department. Several icebreakers were set up for the students to discuss their experiences so far at Georgia Tech and what they want to get out of their degree. This program has evidently had a terrific start, with great support from the department faculty as well as students.<!-- /content -->
