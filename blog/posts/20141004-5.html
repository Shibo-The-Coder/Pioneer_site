When one thinks of a hackathon, computer science and lots of coding generally come to mind. However, Forge has managed to organize a new, novel type of hackathon: one concentrated on healthcare. With the help of various companies, startups, and colleges, Forge created an event where all the participants focused their energies in attempting to solve a critical problem in the medical world, with each topic termed a “pain point”. 
<br>
<br>
The first pain point for the hackathon participants to work on was to facilitate early language exposure to close the word gap between low and high income families. This is because toddlers who are born into lower income families hear around 30 million fewer words in their first few years, which in turn leads to disparities in academic performance. Another paint point was to improve pediatric use of intermittent pneumatic compression devices. These devices are used to treat venous thromboembolisms in adults and are often too bulky for use on children. As a more computer science-oriented topic, the third pain point highlighted the sub-optimal workflow coordination between different teams of doctors and strove to improve the sharing of information and updates between these patient care teams. The fourth pain point, also computer science-based, required teams to create a smartphone app that identifies overseas patients for doctors who went on mission trips, in order to maintain effective medical records. Another problem that was discussed was the challenge of connecting peripheral medical devices, such as feeding tubes and IV pumps, to a computer in order to more quickly synchronize a patient’s medical record chart. The fifth paint point was devising a way to reduce the amount of foreign objects, such as needles or gauze pads, left in a patient’s body after surgery. This issue remains an ongoing and costly problem for hospitals all over the world. Finally, the last challenge in the Forge healthcare hackathon was to try to reduce the incidence of catheter infections at the insertion point, especially for central line catheters. These invasive medical devices lead straight to the heart and cause the most damage if the insertion site is infected.

The teams had varied approaches to the problems, which they all had 36 hours to solve. Each team consisted of 5-8 undergraduate students, grad students, industry professionals, or a combination thereof who came together to devise a solution. Also present were other experts, from specialties in business to medicine to engineering, who served as mentors to help each team reach its maximum potential. The mentors fostered teams by asking them to consider different angles of the problem, explaining more technical aspects of their topic, and aiding in the design of a solution prototype. Overall, the opportunity to ask mentors almost any question proved to be invaluable.

On Sunday, the different teams presented their ideas. Many of the teams designed smartphone apps; for example, the winning team designed one for parents to be able to teach their toddlers to expand their vocabulary early on. However, the unique twist to this hackathon was that there were also several prototypes made out of wood, tape, and plastic, a much easier approach for those with little to no coding experience. For example, one of the teams made a prototype of a device that emitted UV light to disinfect the area of skin around a catheter’s insertion point. Overall, the teams came up with several unique solutions that may someday become patented products, proving that the Forge Healthcare Hackathon was definitely a success. Here’s to hoping that more events like this for the healthcare industry will be conducted in the future, not only in Atlanta but in other biotech hubs as well!<!-- /content -->
