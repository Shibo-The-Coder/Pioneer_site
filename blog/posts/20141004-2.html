Catching up with Tech alumni is always a pleasure, and recently Pioneer had the opportunity to do so with Anu Parvatiyar who graduated from the undergraduate program in the Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering at Georgia Tech and Emory in 2008. Anu was actively involved during her time at Georgia Tech and also served as the undergraduate student body president. Post-graduation, Anu has worked in the medical device industry for several years at CR Bard and now at e-Health Africa. Her new job at e-Health Africa involves travelling to Nigeria to implement a mobile phone platform for the clinics in the vicinity. The goal is to get all the clinics on the same platform and using the same application so that, later on, the government or other health administrators can use the data to identify trends.

Anu came across this opportunity through one of her friends from Georgia Tech. They had both been involved in many activities together during their undergraduate studies and had remained in touch over the past few years due to shared career interest. Anu recalled, “He called me up and said I have a project for you, and I don’t think you are going to be able to say no. A month later, I quit my job and was on a plane to Nigeria.”

On being asked what her motivation was to pursue this project, Anu said that even as an undergraduate she was very interested in public health and design for the developing world. She is interested in what makes technology successful when applied to developing countries. According to Anu, the project with e-Health Africa was “a perfect marriage” between her interests.

<br>
Prior to her current job, Anu worked with CR Bard, a large medical device company. At Bard, she was involved with the entire design process; from concept development to design validation to tooling for manufacturing. She made sure to get involved with the front end of the design process and was interested in understanding the user needs and why they would use a particular product.

Reflecting back on her time at Georgia Tech, Anu wishes that she had had more internship experiences. She said, “I had plans to go to medical school, but I look back on my one internship with a small medical device company, and that changed everything. A doctor that we were working with dealt with about 300 patients in a year, but a medical device could be used by 200,000 patients by the end of the first year.” Her advice to current BME students is to explore all the aspects of BME because there are so many paths that one can take with the problem solving skillset that they have. She also encourages students to go out and meet people in the field and build connections that could help later on. A funny and relatable comment that Anu made perfectly captured the dynamic aspect of BME, “When people ask me what biomedical engineering means, I say I am still figuring that out!”<!-- /content -->
