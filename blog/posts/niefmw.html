<br/>
<br/>
The Career Fair has come and gone, and in its absence midterms have begun. Some of us are putting the finishing touches on our applications for graduate programs, medical schools, and jobs, while others have even begun interviewing for these. Whatever your endeavors, we at Pioneer hope that you experience success. 
<br/>
<br/>
This month, we have put together a fantastic issue that we hope will provide you with entertainment in between study sessions. Included is an interview with one of the Coulter Departmentâ€™s graduates, Anu Parvatiyar, who has worked with both CR Bard and e-Health Africa following her graduation. We also discuss the new BME Mentorship Program headed by Professor Le Doux, including its orientation event â€œWelcome to BME Dayâ€ geared towards helping new students learn about different opportunities available here in the department. Professor Ethier has also continued our monthly After Hours series, writing about his love for walking and music. As well, we have a Biotech Review and hints from recruiters on how to take full advantage of your next career fair, along with much more. Read on to find out what we have in store for you!
