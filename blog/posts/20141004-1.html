<br>
<br>
As some of you know, I lived in England for five years. England is a small and densely populated country, and is crisscrossed by an amazing system of trails that grew out of the British concept of right-of-way, which basically says that once a trail has been established, it becomes public property, no matter where it goes. (This leads to strange situations where trails go right through people's back yards and farms, something that would not go over too well in the US.) The net result is that you can easily start off in one place in the morning and visit on foot, by evening, three or four towns almost anywhere in England. The Brits love doing this, and I caught the bug when I lived there. One year I walked from Oxford to Cambridge with my sons, almost getting killed along the way by a herd of crazed cows (but that is another story). Another year we walked the Cleveland Way (all 110 miles), which is one of the most amazing experiences I have ever had. Long distance walking is a wonderful way to clear your mind. Plus, you get some exercise, can stop at interesting pubs during the day, see beautiful scenery when it is not raining, and meet a few "interesting" people on the way. If I could ever find the time I would like to do one of the El Camino de Santiago walks - 500 mile stroll anyone?

In any case, the US is not as good for those kind of walks because it is a little too spread out and the rights-of-way do not exist (although, of course, there is the remarkable Appalachian Trail that starts in north Georgia). Thus, I have to find other things to do. I love to travel; I have lived and worked in four countries and have visited many more. Some of that travel has been work-related, which tends not to be as much fun because there is not much tourism time. But sometimes one can squeeze in a bit of free time or even take a vacation. Last summer, my wife and I spent three weeks on the road in Britain, Japan and Italy (don’t ask, it's complicated), sampling great food and seeing the sights. I have a particular fondness for Italian food and architecture (who doesn’t!), so the time we spent living in a farm house north of Rome was amazing. More generally, it is good to experience different places and cultures as it makes you think about your home environment in a different way. Also, I read a lot - I always have a book on the go, usually some sort of historical, economic or political non-fiction. The thing I really enjoy the most, though, is music. I play the guitar, and if I had real&nbsp;talent I would have tried to make a career as a musician rather than in academia. Sadly, I'm not good enough to do that, and so I instead content myself by jamming with friends and listening to great music, especially guitar. YouTube is a wonderful resource to find obscure (and amazing) guitarists. Some of my personal favorites include Tomoyasu Hotei, Roy Buchanan, Jerry Douglas and Steve Lukather. Music truly is a good break from thinking about glaucoma and biotransport. To quote Robert Fripp: “Music is the wine that fills the cup of silence.”<!-- /content -->
